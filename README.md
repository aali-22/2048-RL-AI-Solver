# 2048-RL-AI-Solver
This project aims to implement a 2048 game solver utilizing Reinforcement Learning (RL) and search-based techniques. Our objective is to develop an agent that can learn to maximize its score through optimal moves. Additionally, the game logic and graphics would be implemented too.
