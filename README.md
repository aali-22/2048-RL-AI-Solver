# 2048-RL-AI-Solver
## 2048 Solver Using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with PyTorch + Plotly/Dash**

### **Project Overview**

This project aims to create an AI agent capable of mastering the game **2048** using reinforcement learning (RL). The game 2048, a popular tile-sliding puzzle, challenges players to combine numbered tiles to reach the target tile (2048) by choosing optimal moves. Due to the game’s probabilistic nature—where tiles appear randomly on the board—it poses an interesting challenge for RL algorithms.

Our approach will involve training the agent to play and win the game using algorithms like **Actor-Critic** and **Q-Learning** in **PyTorch**. Additionally, we’ll create a user-friendly, interactive **Plotly/Dash** dashboard to visualize the agent's learning process and performance over time. This project is intended as both a technical demonstration of RL in a grid-based environment and a portfolio piece showcasing interactive data visualization.

    - Analyze performance metrics such as win rate, average score, and move efficiency to evaluate each algorithm’s success.
2. **Interactive Visualization and Dashboard**:
    - Create an interactive dashboard using Plotly/Dash to allow real-time observation of the agent’s gameplay, training metrics, and learning progress.
    - Enable users to interact with the dashboard, viewing different game states, win/loss rates, and training data, creating an educational tool that demonstrates RL concepts.
3. **Exploration of AI Techniques in Gaming**:

### **Project Components**

### **1. Game Environment Setup**

- **2048 Game Logic**: Develop the core game logic for 2048, including tile spawning, merging rules, and score calculations. The game should behave identically to the original, with constraints on tile movements and scoring.
- **Grid Display**: Integrate a basic grid display of the game board in the dashboard, allowing users to see the board state after each move.
- **State Representation**: Define an efficient representation of the game state (e.g., a matrix representing tile values) that the RL agent can interpret.

### **2. Reinforcement Learning Agent Implementation**

- **Agent Architecture**: Implement an RL agent with PyTorch that can take in the game state and output a move (up, down, left, or right). We will experiment with the following RL techniques:
    - **Q-Learning**: A value-based method where the agent learns the quality (Q-value) of each action in each state.
    - **Actor-Critic**: A hybrid method with an actor network for policy and a critic network for value estimation, suitable for learning complex policies.
- **Reward System**: Design a reward structure that encourages the agent to maximize its score and reach higher tiles.
- **Training Process**: Train the agent by playing multiple games, iteratively updating the model weights based on the observed rewards and state transitions.

### **3. Model Evaluation and Optimization**

- **Evaluation Metrics**: Track metrics such as win rate, average game score, and maximum tile reached to evaluate the performance of each RL algorithm.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiment with different learning rates, discount factors, and exploration strategies to optimize the agent’s performance.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Compare the performance of Actor-Critic vs. Q-Learning in terms of convergence speed, game scores, and stability.

### **4. Interactive Dashboard (Plotly/Dash)**

- **Live Game Simulation**: Display a real-time simulation of the game with the agent’s chosen moves. This feature allows users to watch the agent in action.
- **Training Metrics and Graphs**: Show visualizations of training metrics such as total rewards, win rate over time, and loss functions.
- **Game Playback Controls**: Add controls to view specific game episodes, replay notable moves, or pause/resume the game for analysis.
- **Customization Options**: Allow users to select which RL algorithm to visualize and adjust parameters like learning rate directly through the dashboard.

### **5. Documentation and User Guide**

- **Project Documentation**: Provide a detailed guide to the code structure, RL models, and dashboard features.
- **User Guide**: Offer instructions on how to use the dashboard and interpret the displayed metrics and game states.

### **Potential Extensions**

- **Algorithm Expansion**: Implement additional RL algorithms like Deep Q-Network (DQN) to see if performance improves with a more complex approach.
- **Multi-Agent Comparison**: Run parallel instances with different algorithms and compare their game results in real-time on the dashboard.
- **Parameter Exploration**: Allow users to change hyperparameters in real-time to see how it affects learning.
